3: The major bike riders fall into the age group of 25-30 and 45-50 years of males. However the ridership among female users also seems to be increasing over time.

The peak at the age group of 45-50 years and the ridership data at the older age groups (above 80-90 years) may also indicate the input error of birth year at the user end.
